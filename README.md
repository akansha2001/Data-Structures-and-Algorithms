## List of Assignments
### Assignment -01
1.	Implement a singly connected linear linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. 

2.	Implement a singly connected circular linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. 

3.	Implement a doubly connected linear linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. 

4.	Implement a doubly connected circular linked list in C. Your program should typically implement insert and delete at all possible locations with proper check(s) as applicable. Include a display function as well and use it to show the content of your list after every operation. Include calls to insert and delete from the main. (For Bonus)

### Assignment -02
1.	Implement Stack using i) fixed memory and ii) dynamic memory representations. In both representations, code the two primitive stack functions. Add a display function to show the content of your stack after every operation.

### Assignment - 03
1.	Evaluate postfix expressions using a Stack. You can use ',' as a delimiter between two tokens in an expression. You can use '$' as the end of input. Always show the intermediate steps including the content of the stack. Take some example postfix expressions. Here is one example:
6, 2, 3, +, -, 3, 8, 2, /, +, *, 2, ^, 3, +, $
(Use '^' for exponentiation)
2.	Write a program for the Tower of Hanoi problem. Experiment with a varying number of discs. Show the intermediate moves in form of messages like the following:
    Move disk ... from rod ... to rod ...

### Assignment - 04
1.	Implement a Queue using i) a fixed memory representation and ii) a dynamic memory representation. In both cases, you should implement the two primitive operations, namely, insert and delete with proper guards. You should experiment with a set of insert and delete operations. Show the contents of your queue after each operation. 
---
### Assignment - 05
1.	Implement a circular queue. Demonstrate that problems appearing in a linear queue can be circumvented in a circular queue.

2.	Implement a min-priority queue. Your program should contain all the necessary functions like extract_min() and others.
---
### Assignment - 06
1.	Compare the performance of following five sorting algorithms on different sets of data:

Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort Insertion Sort, Merge Sort

By different sets of data we mean i) completely unsorted dataset, ii) nearly sorted data etc.

2.	Compare the performance of linear search and binary search algorithms  
---
### Assignment - 07
1.	Test whether a binary tree is a) strictly binary and ii) complete. You can experiment with different sets of nodes (integers or characters).

2.	Obtain a) pre-order, b) in-order and c) post-order traversals of a binary search tree.  You can experiment with different sets of nodes (integers or characters). 

3.	Based on a random set of inputted integers create a binary search tree with the integers as the nodes. Delete at least a) one leaf node, b) a  node with one child and c) a node with two children from the tree you  have created.
---
### Assignment - 08
1.	Given a graph G= (V, E) and a source vertex s, implement Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and grow a BFS tree with root as s. Show some intermediate outputs as well. 

2.	Optional:
Given a directed graph G=(V, E), implement Depth-First-Search (DFS). Your program should invoke DFS_VISIT(u) for any vertex u.  Show some intermediate outputs as well.
